## About the my studio

This documentation is the home of my small studio, where I collect practical notes, patterns, and lessons learned from real projects. The focus is simple:

- Software engineering best practices: architecture, testing, and maintainability.

- Problem solving: concrete examples of debugging, performance tuning, and trade-offs.

- Remote work insights: collaboration patterns, asynchronous workflows, and tooling.

- Experiments and opinions: short posts about tools, libraries, and techniques I tried.

You can use these pages as a reference or a starting point for your own solutions. If you want a quick orientation, start with the [Quickstart](/quickstart). For practical guides and configuration details, see the [Guide](/guide) and [Configuration](/configuration) pages.

## About me

I’m Tomi. I have 8 years of experience as a software engineer, building web and mobile applications and working with cloud platforms. My background includes time at Keller Williams Virtual Spirit and other teams where I focused on delivering reliable, maintainable systems and improving developer workflows.

My intent here is to share what worked (and what didn’t) so you can avoid the same mistakes and adopt useful patterns faster. If you’re looking for examples, start with the Guides or explore the API Reference under the Documentation tab.
