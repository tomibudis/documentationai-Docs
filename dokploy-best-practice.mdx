## Best Practices

### 1. Server Management

**Resource Planning**

- Monitor CPU, RAM, and disk usage regularly

- Plan for growth: allocate 20-30% extra resources

- Use monitoring tools to track resource consumption

**Security**

- Keep Dokploy and Docker updated regularly

- Use strong passwords for admin accounts

- Enable two-factor authentication (if available)

- Regularly review and rotate API keys and tokens

- Configure firewall rules (only open necessary ports)

**Backups**

- Enable automatic backups for all databases

- Store backups in multiple locations (local + cloud)

- Test backup restoration regularly

- Keep backup retention policy (e.g., 30 days)

### 2. Application Deployment

**Environment Separation**

- Use separate projects for dev, staging, and production

- Never use production credentials in development

- Use environment variables for all configuration

- Keep sensitive data out of code repositories

**Git Workflow**

- Use feature branches for development

- Deploy to staging before production

- Tag releases for easy rollback

- Use semantic versioning

**Docker Optimization**

- Use multi-stage builds to reduce image size

- Leverage Docker layer caching

- Use `.dockerignore` to exclude unnecessary files

- Choose appropriate base images (Alpine Linux for smaller images)

**Example optimized Dockerfile:**

```dockerfile
# Multi-stage build example
FROM node:18-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production

FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY . .
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["node", "index.js"]
```

### 3. Database Management

**Connection Pooling**

- Configure appropriate connection pool sizes

- Monitor database connections

- Use connection string environment variables

**Performance**

- Create indexes for frequently queried fields

- Regular database maintenance (VACUUM, OPTIMIZE)

- Monitor slow queries

- Use read replicas for read-heavy applications

**Backup Strategy**

- Daily automated backups

- Test restore procedures monthly

- Keep backups for at least 30 days

- Store backups off-server (S3, Google Cloud Storage)

### 4. Monitoring and Logging

**Application Monitoring**

- Set up health check endpoints

- Monitor application logs regularly

- Use structured logging (JSON format)

- Set up alerts for errors and critical issues

**Resource Monitoring**

- Monitor server resources (CPU, RAM, disk)

- Set up alerts for high resource usage

- Track application response times

- Monitor database performance

**Log Management**

- Centralize logs for easier debugging

- Use log rotation to prevent disk fill-up

- Keep logs for debugging but not indefinitely

- Use log aggregation tools if needed

### 5. Security Best Practices

**Network Security**

- Use HTTPS for all applications

- Configure proper CORS policies

- Use firewall rules to restrict access

- Implement rate limiting

**Application Security**

- Keep dependencies updated

- Scan for vulnerabilities regularly

- Use secrets management for sensitive data

- Implement proper authentication and authorization

- Regular security audits

**Container Security**

- Use minimal base images

- Run containers as non-root user when possible

- Scan Docker images for vulnerabilities

- Keep Docker and containers updated

### 6. Cost Optimization

**Resource Efficiency**

- Right-size your server (not too big, not too small)

- Use resource limits for containers

- Monitor and optimize resource usage

- Scale down unused applications

**Storage Management**

- Clean up old Docker images regularly
