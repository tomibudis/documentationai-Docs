## Workflow

Brainstroming with ChatGPT, Claude or something else about find good idea then execute with this workflow

1. persona ui ux to breakdown the feature -> build PRD documentation

2. persona architech to breakdown what technology on frontend and database, schema data, how to communicate frontend and backend -> build SPEC API endpoint documentation and frontend implementation and additionally create unit test e2e as QA to make sure product stable. breakdown into small section, task, and sub task.

3. persona backend engineer to execute API spec from architech execute per section to get good result and iterate if there is some mistaken

4. (human thinking) find a reference website and theme or color that your prefer to implement on the frontend, save as link.

5. persona frontend (if there no design) generate application based on architech document and features from ui ux persona. -> best tips slicing one by one module or page

6. persona frontend (if there is design reference) communicate with figma MCP or firecrawler MCP to get initial design to build frontend part

7. persona qa to create test case e2e on frontend repository each features that describe from ui ux persona

8. persona dev ops to make it deployment seemless and production get monitoring

DONE!

## Frontend tips

1. start working on small module to get stable structure then continue step by step each features

2. build with isolation module then refactor later
