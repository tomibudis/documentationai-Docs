## Project Showcase Structure

Structure your project sections to grab attention quickly. Start with a hero image or demo, followed by key metrics, tech stack, and a detailed description.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select Key Projects" icon="star">
    Choose 3-5 projects that represent your best work. Prioritize those with measurable impact, like "Increased user engagement by 40%".
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Visuals and Metrics">
    Include screenshots, GIFs, or live demos. Use bullet points for results:

    - Tech stack: React, Node.js, PostgreSQL
    - Live demo: [yourapp.com](https://yourapp.com)
    - GitHub: [repo link](https://github.com/yourusername/project)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Write Compelling Descriptions">
    Describe the problem, your solution, and outcomes in 100-200 words. Emphasize your role and challenges overcome.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Resume Integration

Integrate your resume seamlessly to let visitors download or view it inline. Use embeds for PDFs or structured text sections.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="PDF Embed" icon="file">
    Embed your resume directly:

    ```html
    <iframe
      src="/resume-tom-budi.pdf"
      width="100%"
      height="800px"
      title="Tom Budi Resume"
    />
    ```

    Host the PDF in your `public` folder for Next.js sites.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Markdown Sections" icon="file-text">
    Break it into tabs for quick scanning:

## Contact and About Sections

Craft personal sections that build trust. The About page tells your story; Contact provides easy outreach options.

<CodeGroup tabs="About Section,Contact Form">
  ```jsx
  // About Section (React component)
  function About() {
    return (
      <section>
        <h2>Hi, I'm Tom Budi</h2>
        <p>
          Seasoned engineer specializing in web, mobile, and cloud.
          Passionate about scalable solutions and clean code.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>10+ years experience</li>
          <li>React Native expert</li>
          <li>AWS certified</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
    );
  }
  ```
  ```jsx
  // Contact Form (with validation)
  function Contact() {
    const [formData, setFormData] = useState({ name: '', email: '', message: '' });

    const handleSubmit = async (e) => {
      e.preventDefault();
      await fetch('/api/contact', {
        method: 'POST',
        body: JSON.stringify(formData),
      });
    };

    return (
      <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
        <input
          type="email"
          placeholder="your@email.com"
          value={formData.email}
          onChange={(e) => setFormData({ ...formData, email: e.target.value })}
          required
        />
        <textarea placeholder="Your message" required />
        <button type="submit">Send Message</button>
      </form>
    );
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Best Practices for Content

Follow these practices to make your portfolio professional and user-friendly.

| Practice | Do | Don't |
|----------|----|-------|
| **Content Length** | Keep descriptions concise (150 words max per project) | Write walls of text |
| **Visuals** | Use high-res screenshots and videos | Rely on text alone |
| **SEO** | Add meta titles like "Tom Budi - Web Developer Portfolio" | Ignore search optimization |
| **Accessibility** | Use alt text: `alt="Project dashboard screenshot"` | Skip ARIA labels |
| **Mobile-First** | Test responsiveness with `<1000px` viewports | Design for desktop only |

<Callout kind="tip">
  Update your portfolio quarterly. Track analytics to see which projects get most views and refine accordingly.
</Callout>

<Expandable title="Advanced Customization" default-open="false">
  For dynamic portfolios, integrate a CMS like Contentful:

  ```javascript
  // Fetch projects from API
  const projects = await fetch('/api/projects').then(res => res.json());
  projects.forEach(project => {
    // Render dynamically
  });
  ```

  Use Tailwind CSS for styling: `className="bg-gradient-to-r from-[#c53544] to-red-600"`.
